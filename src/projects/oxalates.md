Oxalates accepted input of foods and their oxalate content.
It allowed a visitor to search for those foods and see their content and category based on serving size.

When my wife was diagnosed with calcium oxalate kidney stones, we started thinking about how to manage her diet.
She was able to find information on the oxalate content of many foods through various sources, but needed a place to track all of that and find it on-demand.
This application allowed her to manage that information and view it on her phone.

Oxalates was a Ruby on Rails server application.
