Chart Search enabled providers to search for medical concepts in the notes left in a patient's medical record.

Chart Search consisted of several services, notably an indexer that could index related medical concepts that were not necessarily documented the same way.

I was on the team that inherited Chart Search and maintained it for a few months.

Of all the solutions I worked on at Cerner, this was the one that had the most users while I was still working on it.
