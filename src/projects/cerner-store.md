The Cerner Store was an online storefront that enableed Cerner clients to purchase some Cerner solutions and publish their own work built on top of Cerner solutions.

It was a Rails application written to support the then-new CSS3 and still support IE6 as the most popular browser.
It accepted user-written content and handled user accounts with OAuth.
Items were indexed for search using Solr.
