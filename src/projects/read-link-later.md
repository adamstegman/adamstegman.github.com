[Read Link Later](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mffbgadohiiggcibdgmogfdlmackfbhm) was a Chrome extension that added "Read Later" links to tweets on [twitter.com](https://twitter.com/) that have URLs.

I retired Read Link Later in 2012.
Twitter keeps updating and I needed to allocate time to other projects instead of this extension.

It handled multiple URLs in a single tweet and updated with the timeline.
