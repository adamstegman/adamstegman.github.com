After working on Cloud Foundry for most of 2014, I wanted to learn more about how it was operated, so I joined the Cloud Ops team in October 2014.

On Cloud Ops, I primarily built tools to monitor and maintain our infrastructure.
I had to coordinate software releases among several teams.
When customers were interested in how to operate the platform they were purchasing, they could bring in someone from the Cloud Ops team to talk about how we operate Pivotal Web Services.

Most of our tooling was built in Ruby or bash, and we deployed everything with either BOSH or Cloud Foundry.
