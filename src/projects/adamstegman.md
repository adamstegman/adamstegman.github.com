[AdamStegman.com](http://adamstegman.com/) is my personal website.

It's the website you're on now.

The website is intended to be a source for my identity, my résumé, and my portfolio.
It will always be evolving.

In early 2018, I rewrote the site using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), a static site generator using React.
It was a fun way to learn a little more about React and GraphQL while redesigning the site.

### History

In 2012, I created the site based on a project on Github called [Nanoc::Heroku](https://github.com/mrrooijen/nanoc-heroku).
It was a website consisting of only static files compiled by a Ruby library called [Nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/).

Before 2012, I just had a Tumblr to hold blog posts.
