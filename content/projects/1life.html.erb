  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>
    1life has been developed alongside the rest of the company since it started several years ago.
    It is written in Ruby on Rails and is deployed to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">Elastic Beanstalk on Amazon Web Services</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are several components to the project.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>API</li>
    <li>Provider application</li>
    <li>Admin application</li>
    <li>Patient application</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    There is a browser client for the API embedded in the provider application.
    Separate projects contain additional clients that the API supports.
