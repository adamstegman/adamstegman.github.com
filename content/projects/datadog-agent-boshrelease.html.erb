  <p>
    To collect metrics from BOSH-deployed machines, I packaged a BOSH release of the <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com">Datadog</a> agent.

  <p>
    We already used <a href="http://bosh.io">BOSH</a> to deploy distributed systems like Elasticsearch, so when we switched our metrics provider to Datadog, we needed to install the agent on our BOSH-deployed machines.
    Writing a BOSH release is how software is packaged for BOSH, so I broke down the automated setup for the Linux agent and re-automated it in the packaging script.

  <p>
    I added configuration support for a few useful features, like AWS tags and agent integrations.
  </p>
  <p>
    I took a small shortcut and used the Ubuntu python packages instead of re-packaging python.
    I may revisit that choice when BOSH supports sharing packages between releases.
