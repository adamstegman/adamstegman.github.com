  <p>
    To aggregate logs from BOSH-deployed machines, I packaged a BOSH release of the <a href="https://www.sumologic.com">Sumo Logic</a> collector.

  <p>
    We already used Sumo Logic to aggregate our logs, so when we began deploying Elasticsearch with <a href="http://bosh.io">BOSH</a>, we wanted to aggregate those logs too.
    Writing a BOSH release is how software is packaged for BOSH, so I automated the Linux collector setup in the packaging script.

  <p>
    Later I added configuration to support a hosted collector so we could point syslog sources to a host that would forward logs to Sumo Logic.
