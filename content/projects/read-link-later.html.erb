    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mffbgadohiiggcibdgmogfdlmackfbhm">Read Link Later</a> was a Chrome extension that added "Read Later" links to tweets on <a href="http://twitter.com/">twitter.com</a> that have URLs.
  </p>
  <p>
    I retired Read Link Later in 2012.
    Twitter keeps updating and I needed to allocate time to other projects instead of this extension.

    It handled multiple URLs in a single tweet and updated with the timeline.
