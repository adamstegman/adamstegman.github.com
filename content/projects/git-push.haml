    Git Push for iOS will be an app that used
    %a{:href => 'http://developer.github.com/v3/git/'} Github's API
    to POST a commit blob to a Github repository.

  %p
    Previously my blog was on
    %a{:href => 'http://adamstegman.tumblr.com/'} Tumblr
    , so I could update it from anywhere using the
    %a{:href => 'http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tumblr/id305343404?mt=8'} iPhone application.
    Now, since I host my
    %a{:href => '/'} website
    and
    %a{:href => 'http://blog.adamstegman.com/'} blog
    myself now and keep all the code on
    %a{:href => 'https://github.com/adamstegman/adamstegman'} Github
    , I need to keep on top of updates.
  %p
    To do that, I want to be able to write a post from anywhere.
    I found the right platform in
    %a{:href => 'https://github.com/meskyanichi/nanoc-heroku'} Nanoc::Heroku
    which you can read more about on the
    %a{:href => '/projects/adamstegman.html'} AdamStegman.com project page.
    Nanoc::Heroku supports
    %a{:href => 'http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/'} Markdown
    pages, which I could easily write from my iPhone or iPad.
  %p
    Unfortunately, there are two key steps missing once I've written something on a mobile device.
  %ul
    %li Commit the post to Github
    %li Run the deploy script
  %p
    Currently, the former is not possible from an iOS device (as far as I can tell).
    To remedy this, I'm writing Git Push.
  %p
    It will create the requisite objects, then use
    %a{:href => 'http://developer.github.com/v3/git/'} Github's new API
    to create a commit in the remote repository.
  %p
    This is an extremely powerful capability.
    I have not yet decided the best user experience for this, but it will likely involve Dropbox or something else instead of allowing in-app editing of files at first.
